# dotprofile 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* This is a pre-alpha version that should not be used until further notice.
* Initial development version. It is worthwhile to note that many tools in
this package were developed under
[another project](https://github.com/jeanmathieupotvin/gather) and isolated
in a separate package for convenience.
